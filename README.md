# Dilly-Dally Projects
Welcome to my sandbox of short, experimental projects — a space for testing ideas, building fun stuff, and exploring whatever catches my interest. These aren't polished apps or full-scale builds, just quick creations made for learning, creativity, and enjoyment.

🎰 Little fun Project: Blackjack
Feeding my (virtual) gambling habits by building a lightweight Blackjack game:

Java version planned if I decide to add a GUI

C++ version if I keep it simple with a command-line interface

Stay tuned for more random side quests — this repo is a mess on purpose -_-
